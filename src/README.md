# todo:

- add to git
- need to read existing contents (per tab) to get categories
    - build a dynamic lookup (in order to remember previous categorizations)
    - use existing system as a backup
- make it so it writes directly to citi tab of existing google sheet
- update spreadsheet to allow for a date column at the beginning (formulas)
- move write functionality to a more generic file (not plugin specific)
- add plugins for chase, cap one, ally, venmo
- write a batch file that calls the app 5x for the different file types
